                            <p>
                                I initiated the project by contacting Mr. Reeder to obtain his site plan and clarify his preferred communication methods. I then coordinated with my junior developers, 
                                Clark Carroll and Forrest Hickman, establishing phone and GitHub communication and assigning roles for each page. I built the initial framework for the Home, Manual 
                                Tutorial, and Ninjabrain Tutorial pages, including the logo, navigation structure, header design, color scheme, and typography. I also set expectations for weekly 
                                progress updates so I could keep Mr. Reeder informed throughout development.
                            </p>
                            <P>
                                I completed the majority of the home page early on and regularly updated the client while continuing efforts to get consistent communication from Forrest. Forrest 
                                eventually added content to the Ninjabrain page, though it required layout correction, while Clark’s assigned page briefly went offline and showed no progress. 
                                This was eventually restored and Mr. Clark helped me finished his assigned page by styling and adding content from the site plan. To improve the site visually, I 
                                incorporated client-approved GIFs in the header and navigation, centered and styled images with white borders, resized the navigation buttons, and replaced 
                                low-contrast hyperlinks with YouTube thumbnails and a styled download button. These changes aligned with Mr. Reeder’s design preferences and enhanced clarity and 
                                usability.
                            </P>
                                By the end of development, the team successfully delivered the full site, complete with all required content, improved visuals, and additional images and GIFs 
                                that helped the overall design feel more polished and engaging.

                            Knight Project
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                For this project I experenced some difficulties with assignment distrabution. I tried to reach out to the team lead, Aidan Kemeny over canvas and continued to go unanswered. 
                                I wan not added to the GitHub till the last week of work and when I was I found that no work had been done on it at all; I also was not given access to the site plan. The 
                                team lead chose to assgin me to the reviews page once I was added to the GitHub, but with no site plane I made a generic page to add your own review. The down side was I had 
                                no idea what was being reviewd so I could not get specific. I eventually reached out to the client, Aubri Knight, for the site plan and discovered that the reviews were 
                                pre-written by her for Horror films. The site is a horror film review site so I disgarded my preivous work and added all her reviews to one page. I had to hund down film posters
                                for each film to add to each review since they were not providd. At this point the Home page and Styling had not been started so I added some styling to see what it looks like. I
                                create color text for h1, h2, h3, and p as well as boardes for the images and footer. I created a nav bar and the footer links and stoped there by repoteing all changes via text to 
                                my team. The client provided feedback that the site was ment to have a gallary of film posters and when you clicked on them it takes you to individual pages with the reivews of the 
                                films. So I created a page for each film that are not visable on the nav bar and I edited the review link on the nav bar to be for a gallary page; I addd this to the footer as well. 
                                After making each review its own page I got approval form the client to us AI to make a review for Alien Vs. Predator using her style since she did not create one. I then added the 
                                review to the proper page. I then infomred my team of all the changes and reminded them to check the GitHub comments I left for each time I made changes.

                                So for this pjocet I have been contacting the team lead, Steven Redd, through canvas repeatedly. I am not added to the GitHub nor have I recieved any communication about what assignment 
                                I should be doing. I do not have the site plan or any idea what the site would be. I thought about reaching out to the client but decided against it since I dont have a page assigned to 
                                develop. Each time we met for class I reached out to the team lead on canvas and never got a reply. I did provide hime with my phone number multiple times but also recieved not commuication.
                                Because of this I have no link to provide for the site.
