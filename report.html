                        Glactic Empire Recruitment Site
                    </h3>

                        <p>
                            As a client, I did struggle at first with not being part of the development process. I really
                            wanted to make the site myself after planning it, and I even started a rough version of the
                            development on my own time. This was because I am a huge Star Wars fan, and so is my father,
                            so I thought making an Empire recruitment site would be a fun project to show off. I am very
                            familiar with the Star Wars universe, so I planned out all the ranks, planets, and famous
                            Empire recruits from Star Wars lore. I used Google to collect images and the GIF for the
                            navigation. I had ChatGPT help me create the FAQ completely and edit the tone of the other
                            pages that I wrote. I also used Google to sample fonts for the page and to find the hex codes
                            for the colors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Eventually, I became comfortable with stepping back and letting someone else develop the
                            site. I did not receive a link or contact information about the site at first, so I chose to
                            reach out to the lead developer, Tristan Zatylny, to request the link. Within a few hours, I
                            received the link along with an apology for sending it so late, which I appreciated.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The site turned out almost exactly as I had imagined, with only a few variations, such as
                            the lack of borders on the footer and different styles of borders on the images. There was
                            an issue with the Ranks & Careers page when I first reviewed it, so I informed the lead
                            developer.
                        </p>

                    </h2>
                        <h3>The Reeder Project</h3>
                            <p>
                                I initiated the project by contacting Mr. Reeder to obtain his site plan and clarify his
                                preferred communication methods. I then coordinated with my junior developers,
                                Clark Carroll and Forrest Hickman, establishing phone and GitHub communication and
                                assigning roles for each page. I built the initial framework for the Home, Manual
                                Tutorial, and Ninjabrain Tutorial pages, including the logo, navigation structure,
                                header design, color scheme, and typography. I also set expectations for weekly
                                progress updates so I could keep Mr. Reeder informed throughout development.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I completed the majority of the home page early on and regularly updated the client
                                while continuing efforts to establish consistent communication with Forrest. Forrest
                                eventually added content to the Ninjabrain page, though it required layout correction,
                                while Clark’s assigned page briefly went offline and showed no visible progress. This
                                was eventually resolved, and Mr. Clark helped me finish his assigned page by styling
                                it and adding content from the site plan. To improve the site visually, I incorporated
                                client-approved GIFs in the header and navigation, centered and styled images with
                                white borders, resized the navigation buttons, and replaced low-contrast hyperlinks
                                with YouTube thumbnails and a styled download button. These changes aligned with
                                Mr. Reeder’s design preferences and enhanced clarity and usability.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                By the end of development, the team successfully delivered the full site, complete
                                with all required content, improved visuals, and additional images and GIFs that
                                helped the overall design feel more polished and engaging. I maintained consistent
                                communication with the client, Mr. Reeder, through Canvas to confirm approvals and
                                provide updates on implemented changes. I shared the site link during the second
                                week, and Mr. Reeder was excellent at staying connected and informing me of his
                                preferences throughout the process.

                        <h3>
                            Knight Project
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                For this project, I experienced several difficulties with assignment distribution. I tried
                                to reach out to the team lead, Aidan Kemeny, over Canvas but did not receive a response.
                                I was not added to the GitHub repository until the last week of work, and when I was
                                added, I discovered that no work had been completed on it. I also was not given access
                                to the site plan. Once I was added to GitHub, the team lead assigned me to the reviews
                                page, but without a site plan, I created a generic page that allowed users to add their
                                own reviews. The downside was that I did not know what was being reviewed, so I could
                                not make the content specific.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I eventually reached out to the client, Aubri Knight, for the site plan and discovered
                                that the reviews were prewritten by her for horror films. Since the site is a horror film
                                review site, I discarded my previous work and added all of her reviews to a single page.
                                I also had to hunt down film posters for each movie to include with the reviews, as they
                                were not provided. At this point, the Home page and styling had not yet been started,
                                so I added basic styling to preview the site’s appearance. I created colored text for
                                h1, h2, h3, and p elements, added borders to images and the footer, and created a
                                navigation bar and footer links. I stopped there and reported all changes to my team
                                via text.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The client later provided feedback that the site was intended to have a gallery of film
                                posters, where clicking on a poster would take the user to an individual page containing
                                that film’s review. In response, I created a separate page for each film that is not visible
                                in the navigation bar and updated the Reviews link in the navigation bar to point to a
                                gallery page. I also added this link to the footer. After making each review its own page,
                                I received approval from the client to use AI to generate a review for Alien vs. Predator
                                using her writing style, as she had not created one. I then added this review to the
                                appropriate page. Finally, I informed my team of all changes and reminded them to
                                review the GitHub comments I left each time updates were made.

                          <p>
                            For this project, I repeatedly attempted to contact the team lead, Steven Redd, through
                            Canvas. I was not added to the GitHub repository, nor did I receive any communication
                            regarding which assignment I should complete. I was not provided with the site plan
                            and had no information about what the site would be. I considered reaching out to the
                            client but decided against it since I had not been assigned a specific page to develop.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each time we met for class, I contacted the team lead through Canvas but did not receive
                            a response. I also provided my phone number multiple times, yet I still received no
                            communication. Because of this lack of coordination, I do not have a site link to
                            provide for this project. This means that the image is not linked to an external site.

                        General Experence
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            The most challenging part of this project was working in a team. Writing code is relatively 
                            straightforward; however, assigning tasks and receiving clear assignments proved to be much 
                            more difficult. Distributing assignments was easier than receiving them in my role as a junior 
                            developer. This experience highlighted the importance of effective communication and professional 
                            networking. I worked to overcome these challenges by proactively reaching out to my junior 
                            developers through Canvas and SMS messaging. I used positive encouragement and professional 
                            delegation to keep the team engaged. I also maintained consistent communication with the 
                            client, Mr. Reeder, to ensure expectations were clear. In my role as a junior developer, I 
                            continuously attempted to communicate with my lead developers, but with limited success. I 
                            remained professional in all outreach through Canvas and SMS and received only one response 
                            related to the Knight Project, and unfortunately none for the Helms Project. To move forward, 
                            I reached out directly to the client for the Knight Project to obtain the site plan needed to 
                            complete my assigned tasks. My fellow junior developer, Spencer Earl, stayed in contact with me 
                            both in person and through SMS, allowing us to complete our portions of the work collaboratively. 
                            While the entire site was not completed, I believe we were successful in maintaining professional 
                            communication and teamwork under challenging circumstances.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What I enjoyed most about this project was seeing how far my skills have progressed. I significantly 
                            improved my speed in site creation by not only reusing previous code, but also refining and enhancing 
                            it to be more effective. Throughout the project, I encountered new challenges involving image styling, 
                            link behavior, and creating visual emphasis within muted color schemes. Each challenge pushed me to think 
                            more creatively and to discover new solutions through experimentation and research. This experience deepened 
                            my appreciation for web design and ultimately inspired me to add it as my minor at BYU–Idaho.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If I were able to complete this project again, I would implement regular team meetings, such as 
                            stand-up meetings. These meetings would allow the team to track completed tasks and upcoming work, 
                            helping ensure the site is developed to the highest possible standard. This approach would also reduce 
                            communication gaps, prevent missed deadlines, and simplify the creation of required project reports. 
                            Additionally, regular meetings would encourage more creative input from junior developers, ensuring that 
                            design and styling decisions are collaborative rather than limited to the lead developer and the client. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           After this experience, I feel confident working on real-world projects. Given another person’s vision, 
                           I had no difficulty bringing the design to life and even contributed several enhancements of my own. I 
                           maintained consistent communication with the client, and when my suggestions were not aligned with his 
                           expectations, I was able to pivot quickly and offer alternative solutions that contributed to the project’s 
                           overall success. I especially enjoyed seeing how much my skills have improved—tasks that once took hours 
                           now take only minutes. This progress allowed me to explore new design techniques and further expand my 
                           understanding of web development.
